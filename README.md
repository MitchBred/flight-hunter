# Flight Hunter

This is a Flight Hunter made with a Raspberry pi 3B+. It can take photos or videos and store them on an AWS S3 cloud.
This project was created[position_and_speed.py](calculations%2Fposition_and_speed.py) because a Raspberry pi 3b+ has been in the closet for years.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- Install 64 bits version Ubuntu Server and not a 32 bits version.
- Can only use capture functions on the Raspberry pi.
- [Check](https://youtu.be/bwE4Mr-2ksQ) the right user privileges before you install the project on the Raspberry pi.
- [Check how to](youtube.com/watch?v=nx8gDSS1vO4) connect the camera connection through the Raspberry pi.
- Check sometimes your logging `cat /var/log/syslog`
